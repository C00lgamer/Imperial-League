 egypt.1.d:0 "Egypt and Sudan had been at odds over their common border ever since they were both colonies of the United Kingdom. While Egypt cites the 22th Northern Parallel as the rightful border, Sudan points to a British colonial decision that cedes the triangle of Hala'b (also 'Halayeb') to British Sudanese administrative territories. Sudanese forces had taken control of the area in 1992, when Egypt was unable to resist their incursion. Now, at a new national strength, it is time to revisit our policy."

 election_USA.1.t:0 "Election of 2000"
 election_USA.1.d:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2000 was one of the most controversial elections in the history of the United States of America. After incumbent president Bill Clinton had served his two terms since 1992, he was not allowed to run for the democratic party again. In his place, the democrats nominated a relatively young environmental activist and former Senator of Tennessee by the name of Al Gore, while the Republicans sent a classical Southern Republican, George W. Bush, son of George H. W. Bush, who had preceded Clinton as president (1988-1992), while Al Gore himself had been Vice President under Clinton. \n\nAfter all votes were counted, it got clear that Gore by far had won the popular vote, but he did not win the electoral college, which is decided by which state has which majority, discarding the proportional votes in each state. Bush received 50.4 million votes, Gore 50.99 million, but, thanks to an incredibly close race in Florida, which was decided by less than 600 votes, Bush won Florida and thus the presidency. Democrats demanded a recount, which could not be granted because of Florida voting systems. The Supreme Court is about to overturn the demand for a recount. What should be done?"
 election_USA.1.o1:0 "No recounts required! Bush!"
 election_USA.1.o2:0 "By popular force: Gore!"
 election_USA.2.t:0 "Election of 2004"
 election_USA.2.d1:0 "After the painful and unlucky defeat in 2004, Al Gore had pulled out of politics to focus on his environmentalist campaigns again. In his place, the democratic party nominated one of its most established political veterans, John Kerry from Massachusetts. \n\nAgainst him, as expected, stands the ruling president, George W. Bush. The focus of the campaign is on terrorism inside and outside the United States, about the conflict in the Middle East, about shady dealings of the administration of Bush and Cheney and about the environment, which Bush was far less fond of protecting than Kerry."
 election_USA.2.d2:0 "After the victory of 2004, Al Gore set to implement environmental and social reforms that were opposed as violating the national spirit and strength by the Republican opposition. \n\nAfter George W. Bush had lost in 2000, he pulled out of politics and rejoined the oil industry in Texas. In his place, the Republican Party nominated Newt Gingrich, a fundamentalist right-winger who was supposed to appeal to the people on a more ideological base than Bush had. The democrats meanwhile had no real opposition. While both former First Lady Hillary Clinton and a young African American senator from Illinois had thought about running a campaign, it was clear that the party stood united behind Al Gore, who is favorite to win against Gingrich."
 election_USA.2.o1:0 "We will finish Al-Qaeda! Bush!"

 election_USA.3.t:0 "Election of 2008"
 election_USA.3.d:0 "After several government crises and conflicts, the Democratic Party wanted a new face that would lead the party into a new age of popularity with young people, ethnic minorities and women; all population groups that traditionally were not drawn towards the Republican Party anyway. This new face came in the shape of Illinois Senator Barack Hussein Obama, who won the primary contests against Bill Clinton's wife and former First Lady Hillary Clinton. The Republican contests were also fierce, with the hardline faction finally losing out to the moderate fiscal conservatives around Vietnam veteran John McCain. \n\nOn election night, it seems like the Democrats, whose election slogan 'Yes, we can!' is heard across the country, might have the edge by as many as ten million votes. But who knows who could win?"
 election_USA.3.o1:0 "Yes we can! Obama!"
 election_USA.3.o2:0 "Safety and Democracy! McCain!"
 election_USA.4.t:0 "Election of 2012"
 election_USA.4.d:0 "After a relatively satisfying first term in office, it was quite clear that the Democratic Party would stand behind its incumbent president Barack Obama for the 2012 Presidential Election. The Republican Party had to readjust after the gamble to mix radical and moderate Republicans had failed with the McCain-Palin ticket of 2008.\n\nThe Republicans went through a primary process with many voters from many parts of the Republican Party, from strict christians like Rick Santorum to Rick Perry to libertarian approaches like the one of Ron Paul. The GOP in the end chose Mitt Romney, a former Mormon missionary and current Governor of Massachusetts.\n\nLike with the last election, Obama seems to have the edge with young people and minorities, which in theory should make him easily win - but in the end, it comes down to a good strategy and a bit of luck."
 election_USA.4.o1:0 "Four more years!"
 election_USA.4.o2:0 "Romney and Ryan... sounds good to me."
 election_USA.5.t:0 "Election of 2016"
 election_USA.5.d:0 "The US Presidential Election of 2016 might have been one of the most heated and ideologically charged political showdowns of the 21st Century. The Election was, in the best style of American democracy, not decided by committed supporters of either side, but by regular people who found the candidate they did not vote for unbearable as president. \n\nSucceeding a strong eight years under a democratic government, the Democratic Party quickly fell into a two-candidate battle between declared Democratic Socialist and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on one side, and former First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the other. Clinton, although accused of corruption and overly friendly stances towards international companies, managed to beat Sanders with a mix of party corruption and a strong support base in the more conservative states in the south and center of the country. \n\nThe Republicans meanwhile found themselves unable to quickly designate a front runner, with more than a dozen candidates initially running. After eliminating his competitors John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, reality show star and billionaire Donald Trump won with aggressive rhetoric and with a style of providing simple answers to complicated questions. \n\nThe disapproval ratings for both candidates pass 50% of the populous. Neither party finds anything appealing about the other candidate. Both rational and widely popular candidates have failed. It has come down to one final question - A woman deeply involved with big business and shady dealings or a man regularly publishing neo-fascist propaganda on social media?"

Although many of the crew members survived the initial explosions, which were even registered by seismographs in the US state Alaska, and were trapped under the sea, the slow and ineffective Russian response ultimately led to the death of all 118 sailors."

However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardize the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."
