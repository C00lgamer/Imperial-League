 TITLE_SHIELDING_RESEARCH_SUBTITLE:0 "Shielding Research"
 shielding:0 "Primitive Shielding"
 shielding_desc:0 "This basic level of shielding has no place in mobile warfare yet due to generators being impractically large. They do however offer static defense options."
 shielding2:0 "Shielding miniaturization I"
 shielding2_desc:0 "The first shielding prototypes that were small enough to be used in combat were placed on Main Battle Tanks and Ships. Even though the shields were weak and unable to completely stop hits from heavy weaponry the interruption a projected shield would offer was enough to let explosive rounds detonate early and rounds that intended to pierce deflect to either miss or hit at less dangerous angles. Having the shield did however limit the fire-power as the shield had to be carefully switched off and on to fire through but that was considered a small sacrifice for greater survivability."
 shielding3:0 "Shielding miniaturization II"
 shielding3_desc:0 "Even smaller generators allowed for the first generations of shielded aircraft as well as adapting light tanks to carry them. The aircraft suffered with the weight and size of both the power generation and the generator but the ability to block most incoming hits made them near invincible to missiles."
 shielding4:0 "Shielding miniaturization III"
 shielding4_desc:0 "As smaller and smaller generators became available they became commonplace in all militairy vehicles, while it wasn't able to protect infantry in the field it did heighten the survivability while in transport."
 shielding5:0 "Personal Shielding"
 shielding5_desc:0 "The point had finally been reached where small shielding devices could be carried by individuals in the field, changing the way combat was fought as infantry suddenly became a lot harder to kill."
